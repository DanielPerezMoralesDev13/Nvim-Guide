# Debian Ubuntu Install
sudo apt-get install nvim
```

## ***Customization***

> *Neovim is highly customizable. You can customize it by modifying the `init.vim` configuration file located at `~/.config/nvim/` on Unix systems. Here are some common settings you can add to your `init.vim` file:*

```vim
" Disable backup creation
set nobackup
set nowritebackup

" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax enable

" Set theme
colorscheme desert

" Adjust tab size to 4 spaces
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab
```

## ***Installing Extensions***

*Neovim is highly extensible thanks to its extensive collection of extensions. You can install extensions using a package manager like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). Here's an example of how to install a plugin using vim-plug:*

1. *Install vim-plug following the instructions on its repository.*
2. *Add desired plugins to your `init.vim` file:*

   ```vim
   call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

   " Example Plugin
   Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'

   call plug#end()
   ```

3. *Save the file and reload the Neovim configuration by running:*

   ```bash
   :source ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
   ```

4. *Install the plugins by running:*

   ```bash
   :PlugInstall
   ```

## ***Creating Extensions***

*If you're interested in creating your own extensions for Neovim, you can find detailed documentation on the [official Neovim website](https://neovim.io/doc/user/).*
